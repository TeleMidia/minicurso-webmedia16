\begin{abstract}
  This short course is an introduction to GStreamer, one of the main
  free/open-source frameworks for multimedia processing.  We start
  presenting GStreamer, its architecture and the dataflow programming model,
  and then adopt a hands-on approach.  Starting with an example, a simple
  video player, we introduce each concept of GStreamer’s basic C API and
  implement it over the initial example incrementally, so that at the end of
  the course we get a complete video player with support for the usual
  playback operations (start, stop, pause, seek, fast-forward, and rewind).
  We also discuss sample filters---processing elements that manipulate audio
  and video samples.  We present the various filters nativelly available in
  GStreamer and show how one can extend the framework by creating a plugin
  with a custom filter that manipulates video samples.  The only
  prerequisite for the short course is a basic knowledge of the C
  programming language.  At the end of the short course, we expect that
  participants acquire a general view of GStreamer, and be able to create
  simple multimedia applications and explore its more advanced features.

\section*{BIO}

\noindent\emph{Guilherme F.~Lima} is an associate researcher at the TeleMídia
Lab.~in PUC-Rio, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  His research interests include
programming languages and models for multimedia synchronization, in
particular, those occurring in the intersection between synchronous
languages and multimedia.  He holds a Sc.D.~(2015) and a Sc.M.~(2011) in
Informatics, and a B.A.~(2009) in Information Systems, all from PUC-Rio.

\noindent\emph{Rodrigo C.\,M.~Santos} is a PhD~Candidate in Informatics at
Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio).  He earned a
Master's Degree in Computer Science from Federal University of Maranhão
(UFMA) in 2013.  His main research interests are inter-media
synchronization, distributed multimedia systems, reactive/synchronous
programming and multimedia programming languages.  Currently he is a
Researcher at TeleMídia Lab (PUC-Rio) and Research Intern at IBM Brazil.
